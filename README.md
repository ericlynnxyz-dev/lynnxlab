Gold Calculations

Conversion Logic
1 Kyat = 16 Pae

1 Pae = 8 Yway

1 Kyat = 128 Yway

1 Kyat ≈ 16.329 grams

Pricing Logic
User inputs current gold price per Kyat (16K base)

User selects gold purity from dropdown: 16K, 15K, 14.5K, 14K, 12K

Pricing formulas:

15K = (16K ÷ 17) × 16

14.5K = (128 × 16K) ÷ 140

14K = (16 × 16K) ÷ 18

12K = 16K × 0.75
